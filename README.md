## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (recommended for package management)

### Required Libraries

To run this project, you will need to install the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env_name
   source env_name/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env_name\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:  
   Use the command provided above to install the required libraries.

### Running the Notebook

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook from your terminal:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Run the `CustomerChurnPrediction.ipynb`**:
   Open the notebook and execute the cells to explore the analysis and model predictions.

## Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - The project uses the dataset `churn2.csv`, which contains customer information.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering are performed to prepare the dataset for modeling.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Various machine learning models are trained to predict customer churn, with evaluation metrics to assess performance.

4. **Results Analysis**:
   - Insights and visualizations are provided to understand churn patterns and the effectiveness of the model.
